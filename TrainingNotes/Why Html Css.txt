* Creating web applications in 2 ways :

	(i) Scripting languages 
	(ii) Programming Languages

* Scripting Languages :
	Interprted during runtime, hence takes lot of time to execute.

* Programming Languages :
	Compiled first during runtime, hence takes less time to execute.


* In web applications we can implement :-

	(i) Client-Side :
		- Enable to access the app from same client 
		- Network traffic is high
		- A bit slower
